Experienced at Game Development and Web Development software engineer,
currently focusing my attention on developing myself more as a Full Stack software engineer.
While working on project, I'm focused on solving global issues and creating reliable and maintainable architecture
more than focusing on smaller project parts. Always open for new technologies.
Would like to take part in some of Web 3.0 or/and AI projects. Would like to take more responsibilities as a team leader
and ready to participate in any mentorship program. In spare time I learn interesting technologies, that might be not useful
for me on real projects but make myself see things from different perspective. My strongest professional quality is adaptivity along with
ability to learn and become fluent in almost any technology (depends on its main paradigms) really fast.
